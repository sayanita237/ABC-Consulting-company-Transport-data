# ABC-Consulting-company-Transport-data

You work for an office transport company. You are in discussions with ABC Consulting company for providing transport for their employees. For this purpose,you are tasked with understanding how do the employees of ABC Consulting prefer to commute presently (between home and office). Based on the parameters like age, salary, work experience etc. given in the data set ‘Transport.csv’,you are required to predict the preferred mode of transport. The project requires you to build several Machine Learning models and compare them so that the model can be finalised.

1. Read the dataset. Do the descriptive statistics and do the null value condition check. Write an inference on it.

Perform Univariate and Bivariate Analysis. Do exploratory data analysis. Check for Outliers.

Encode the data (having string values) for Modelling. Is Scaling necessary here or not? Data Split: Split the data into train and test (70:30)
